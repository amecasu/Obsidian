## 2. **Clarify Reject Belt System**
   - Confirm if the machine has:
     - A reject belt section directly on the balancing machine for depositing faulty parts (e.g., bad parts cycle belt).
     - Or if faulty parts are placed on the workpiece carrier (WPC) and later ejected via a coding system on the analysis/reject belt in the circulation.

## 3. **Check for Additional Measurements**
   - Confirm if the machine has additional measurement capabilities, such as eccentricity measurement (like the FPC5).

## 4. **Provide Information on Workpiece Carriers (WPC)**
   - Specify the type of WPC used on the line.
   - Indicate if you use the **Rexroth TS1 transfer system** (as shown in the picture they referenced).
   - Confirm if there is a **WPC coding system** in place, such as the **Rexroth ID200** (as shown in the picture they referenced).

## 5. **Explain Scrap Part Handling**
   - Describe how scrap parts are currently handled on your balancing machine:
     - Do you need to stop the machine and manually remove them?
     - Or are bad parts automatically ejected from the station?

By addressing these points and providing the requested pictures, you’ll help your colleague and the balancing expert gather the necessary information to assist you further.
